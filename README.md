# atom-jshint package

This is a *very* alpha version of this package. This is purely proof that it can work.

Installation
===

`apm install atom-jshint`

Usage
===

Select some code, then hit `ctrl+alt+j` or click `Packages > JSHint > Run against selection`

The output is only displayed in the console right now so you'll need to open developer tools. `View > Developer > Toggle Developer Tools` or `alt+cmd+i`


Features not yet implemented:
  * Custom config files
  * Output in a nicer way
